jslib
=====

A collection of Javascript functions and plugins I've made over the years as a web developer. It's here on github more as posterity, rather than any serious attempt at development.

All of the (limited) functionality in here can be reproduced with JQuery, and much better. Seriously, use JQuery, not this.

Functionality includes:
* multiple functions on document load (jslib.onload)
* observer design pattern implementation (jslib.events)
* debugging tools (jslib.debug)
* simple image gallery (jslib.gallery)
* unfinished migration of a drag and drop library. Probably doesn't work, and isn't tested.

There are demos of each library/plugin in the demos directory.
